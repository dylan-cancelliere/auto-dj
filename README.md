# Auto-DJ!

## Setup
If you want to run AutoDJ on your machine, the following steps should get you up and running fairly quickly (Eventually the site will be hosted on [AutoDJ.io](https://www.autodj.io)

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install` in the root directory, and in the `client` subfolder
3. Go back to the root directory and run `npm run dev`.  By default, this will start a server at `localhost:5000` and run the page at `localhost:3000` (so you should type in `localhost:3000` in your browser if you want to go to the site)

That's it!  You should be able to click the **Login with Spotify** button to get authenticated, and then you're good to go!

Feel free to contact me @dylan-cancelliere if you have any questions, or open an issue/pr if you want to help out.
