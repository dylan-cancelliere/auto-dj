Minimum Viable Product:
	-Some sort of website or app that people can use to pick the next song at a party.
	-In order to do that, we want to be able to do the following:
		-Show the queue (What's up next)
		-Use Spotify API to suggest a song to add to the Queue
		-Have a "Party code/pin" so that people can join a particular session
		-Vote on the suggestions and see the results in realtime
			-Decide how a song passes or fails a vote

Planned features:
	-Both website and app functionality
	-Pandora, Apple Music, etc support

How we're going to go about doing this:
	-Dylan:
		-Do all the frontend, both the website and eventually the app
		-Help with general structure of backend
	-Sam:
		-Focus on API functionality
		-General backend structure
